# Bouncing balls across the screen using Javascript

# Description
A class project using HTML, CSS and Javascript to make balls bounce across the screen. 
It basically takes 2 div elements and uses CSS to turn them into balls.
From there I use Javascript to move the ball around a box. 
 
# Installation
There isn't any instalation needed, simply download the HTML file and open it in your browser. 

# Usage 
Once you open the HTML file the balls should start moving right away. 

# Support
If there are any issues you can email me or reach out to me on LinkdenIn

# Roadmap: 
Coming soon is the balls bouncing in the browser space instead of a square.
On the list: balls appear on click.
