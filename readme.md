# Bouncing balls across the screen using Javascript

# Description
A class project using HTML, CSS and Javascript to make balls bounce across the screen. 
It basically takes 2 div elements and uses CSS to turn them into balls.
From there I use Javascript to move the ball around a box. 
 
# Installation
There isn't any instalation needed, simply download the HTML file and open it in your browser. 

# Usage 
Once you open the HTML file the balls should start moving right away. 

# Support
If there are any issues you can email me or reach out to me on LinkdenIn

# Roadmap: 
Last Update: 8.6.2021 (added logic for balls bouncing inside browser window).  
Coming soon: balls appear on click
